#Background

Fresh kicks is an interactive animation project. It is most similar to the kids toy, paper doll. When you open the project there is set of drawn "dolls" to choose from wearing various all white outfits. The user can choose a pattern from a predetermined set and drag them onto the "doll's" clothes. When the pattern is dropped onto the doll, the pattern becomes animated. for instance, if one pattern consisted of palm trees, the tree trunks might start swaying. 

Eventually I'd like the doll to do a dance move when all the blank white of their original outfit is covered in patterns. 

#MVPs
This is an animation project where you can choose the patterns for a persons outfit. 
Features: 
  - Render a person figure with all white outfit
  - render at least one pattern option that has animation built in after it has been dropped onto the person target
  - render a visually appealing area for the person to be center state
  - add additional outfit options
  - add additional pattern options
  - add animation to the figure/person/doll
  
  #Technologies
  To be totally honest I am not sure how this is all going to play out, but here's my initial idea for architecture
  -HTML elements for the outfit and pattern options (always on the screen)
  -Vanilla js for the conditionally rendered buttons
  -html 5 and canvas for the pattern animation and eventual dance move and drag and drop feature
  -CSS for the html elements and general dom layout
